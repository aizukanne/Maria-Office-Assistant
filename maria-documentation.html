    <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
    <p>Maria brings together three core elements to deliver value:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Channels:</strong> Users interact through familiar collaboration interfaces. Maria supports conversational interactions (chat or voice) and structured inputs (forms) to gather the right details at the right time.</li>
      <li><strong>Orchestration:</strong> Conversations are guided to clarify intent, apply policies, and route requests to the appropriate actions or information sources. Maria captures context and maintains continuity to reduce repetitive questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Knowledge and integrations:</strong> Maria retrieves approved information and interfaces with enterprise systems to present results or draft next steps. Connections emphasize safety, auditability, and control.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">Conceptually: users engage via collaboration interfaces; Maria orchestrates the request; knowledge and enterprise systems contribute information or actions; results are returned as clear, verifiable outputs for human decision-making.</p>

  <section id="detailed-functionality" class="section">
    <h2>Detailed Functionality</h2>
    <p>This section describes how Maria operates in day-to-day use, focusing on what it does, typical inputs and outputs, example interactions, admin controls, and important considerations. It avoids implementation or internal details.</p>

    <h3>Communication</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What it does:</strong> Participates in conversations, replies in threads, and provides summaries or follow-ups across supported channels.</li>
      <li><strong>Typical inputs:</strong> Direct messages, mentions, replies in threads, short form inputs, or voice notes (where enabled).</li>
      <li><strong>Typical outputs:</strong> Contextual replies, threaded summaries, action lists, and follow-up drafts ready for human send.</li>
      <li><strong>Example interactions:</strong> “Summarize this discussion and propose next steps.” • “Draft a polite reply confirming we received the request and will respond by tomorrow.”</li>
      <li><strong>Admin controls:</strong> Channel scope, mention behavior, response length, escalation triggers, and opt-out rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Seeks clarification when needed; avoids committing to actions without explicit confirmation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Assistance</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What it does:</strong> Retrieves information from approved sources and, if enabled, public web content to answer questions and provide concise synopses.</li>
      <li><strong>Typical inputs:</strong> Questions with optional context or links; requests to compare policies, procedures, or reference materials.</li>
      <li><strong>Typical outputs:</strong> Concise answers, bullet-point summaries, and source references (where available).</li>
      <li><strong>Example interactions:</strong> “Give a two-paragraph overview of our travel policy for new hires.” • “Compare these two documents and list the key differences.”</li>
      <li><strong>Admin controls:</strong> Source allowlists/denylists, citation requirement, maximum depth/timeouts.</li>
      <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Highlights uncertainty; invites verification for sensitive or high-impact decisions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Document Processing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What it does:</strong> Reads common document formats, extracts key points, and can produce summaries or formatted outputs (such as PDF deliverables) according to policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Typical inputs:</strong> Uploaded files or accessible links (policies, briefings, notes, images).</li>
      <li><strong>Typical outputs:</strong> Executive summaries, highlights and action items, or ready-to-share formatted documents.</li>
      <li><strong>Example interactions:</strong> “Summarize these meeting notes with owners and deadlines.” • “Create a one-page brief from this policy.”</li>
      <li><strong>Admin controls:</strong> Allowed file types and sizes, retention limits, export formats, and sharing rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Honors data boundaries; may request additional context if content is incomplete.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Message Management</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What it does:</strong> Helps organize conversations by summarizing long threads, highlighting decisions, and prompting for unresolved items.</li>
      <li><strong>Typical inputs:</strong> Thread links or prompts to “recap” or “extract decisions.”</li>
      <li><strong>Typical outputs:</strong> Thread recaps, decision logs, open items with suggested owners.</li>
      <li><strong>Admin controls:</strong> Rules for mention frequency, recap cadence, and content boundaries.</li>
      <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Sensitive content can be omitted or generalized according to policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User and Admin Controls</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What it does:</strong> Supports role-based access and policy-driven behavior (tone, escalation, content boundaries).</li>
      <li><strong>Typical inputs:</strong> Admin settings for roles, channels, retention, and safety rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Typical outputs:</strong> Consistent responses aligned with organizational policies and audiences.</li>
      <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Changes to controls may require review to maintain consistency and compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Integrations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What it does:</strong> Connects to widely used collaboration and business platforms to fetch information or prepare drafts for routine actions.</li>
      <li><strong>Typical inputs:</strong> Requests such as “show status,” “prepare a draft update,” or “summarize recent activity.”</li>
      <li><strong>Typical outputs:</strong> Status summaries, prepared drafts for human send, or next-step checklists.</li>
      <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Specific connectors and permissions are confirmed during discovery; actions require explicit user confirmation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Workflow Orchestration</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What it does:</strong> Guides multi-step processes using checklists, requests confirmations, and tracks progress for visibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Typical inputs:</strong> Task lists, forms, or prompts like “help me complete the onboarding checklist.”</li>
      <li><strong>Typical outputs:</strong> Structured steps, reminders, and handoff-ready drafts.</li>
      <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Designed for human-in-the-loop review; responsibilities and approvals remain with your team.</li>
    </ul>
